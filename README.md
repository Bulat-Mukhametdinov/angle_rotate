## Finding coordinates
Let's assume that we have learned to somehow find the coordinates of interest in order to further determine the angle of rotation. Now you can use the program's graphical interface to determine the required coordinates.

## Entering coordinates
1. Launch the program.
2. Use the GUI to mark the coordinates of interest in the image.
3. Use the "REDO" button to clear all coordinates. When entering coordinates is complete, use the "DONE" button.

## Visualization of the algorithm's operation
After entering the coordinates, the left image will begin to rotate, simulating different angles. Among other things, the screen will display the angle by which you want to rotate the left picture, and the right will show the picture after rotation.

## Rotation control
The "FLIP" button allows you to change the direction of rotation, while the "STOP" button stops the rotation. Press 'q' to stop the programm

## Running the program
To run the main program `main.py` you need to run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
pip install -r pip-requirements
```
